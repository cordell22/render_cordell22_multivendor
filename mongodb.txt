mongodb+srv://cordel22:<password>@cluster0.ioypxqt.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

fromline:
Replace <password> with the password for the cordel22 user. Ensure any option params are URL encoded.

mdn:
Click the Copy icon to copy the connection string.
Paste this in your local text editor.
Update the password with your user's password.
Replace myFirstDatabase with local_library_drill.
Save the file containing this string somewhere safe.


You have now created the database, and have a URL (with username and password) that can be used to access it. This will look something like: mongodb+srv://your_user_name:your_password@cluster0.upbx7.mongodb.net/local_library?retryWrites=true&w=majority


npm install async

Run the script using node in your command prompt, passing in the URL of your MongoDB database (the same one you replaced the insert_your_database_url_here placeholder with, inside app.js earlier):
node populatedb <your mongodb url>
